Description: reads instructions from a file and creates a Bell-LaPadula security system
             *uses command line argument for instructionlist file

Note: this program will not work with python3 because print statement syntax is different, it only works with 
      python 2.7 that is currently running on the UNT CSE machines

To compile and run: 
        python Bell-LaPdula.py instructionListFileName
